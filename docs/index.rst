finagg: Financial Aggregation for Python
========================================

**finagg** is a Python package that provides implementations of popular and free
financial APIs, tools for aggregating data from those APIs into SQL databases,
and tools for transforming aggregated data into features useful for analysis
and AI/ML.

**finagg** currently supports the following free APIs:

* The Bureau of Economic Analysis `(BEA) API`_.
* The Federal Reserve Economic Data `(FRED) API`_.
* The Securities and Exchange Commissionâ€™s `(SEC) EDGAR API`_.

In addition, **finagg** provides methods for:

* downloading data from these APIs
* inserting downloaded data into "raw" SQL tables
* aggregating raw data into "refined" SQL tables
* analyzing/inspecting raw and refined data

making **finagg** ideal for offline analysis.
