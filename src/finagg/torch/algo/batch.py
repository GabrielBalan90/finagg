    #: Key denoting features output from a policy model.
    #: Typically processed by a policy action distribution.

    #: Key denoting features output by a policy action distribution.
    #: Usually propagated through an environment.
    ACTIONS = "actions"

    #: Key denoting the log probability of taking `actions` with feature
    #: and a model. Typically used by learning algorithms.

    #: Key denoting value function approximation from a policy model.
    #: Typically used by learning algorithms or for analyzing a trained model.

    #: "padding_mask" elements.

    #: Key denoting elements that're used for indicating padded elements
    #: with respect to elements corresponding to an "inputs" key.

    #: Key denoting view requirements applied to another key. These are
    #: the preprocessed inputs to a model.
